# Note Taker - Module 11 Challenge

## Description
This week, I was able to use express.js to create a note taker. I was able to create an app that would receive user's input, save it, display it to the user, and give them the ability to delete the note. The user would be able to use this note taker however they wish. It could be used as a reminder, to-do list, or an event calendar (without dates).
